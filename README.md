# Some function I use in Experience Design
* Randomization test: use all combination to get the p-value
  1. suitable when the sample size is small.
* Monte Carlo approach: use sample to get the result
  1. if the sample size is large, use this approach can reduce the computing time.
* Latin Square: used when we don't have enough samples to construct the experiment.
  1. compare to randomazation test, it needs less samples, but less accurate.
